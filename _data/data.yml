career-profile:
  title: Summary
  summary: |
    I’m a backend developer with over 10 years of experience in software development: web development, RESTful APIs, object-oriented design, database modelling...
    I'm an easy learner, self-taught, organised, detail-oriented.
    I take ownership and suggest improvements to workflows and processes.
    I value communication, be it written, spoken and/or async (remote-first approach).
    I have an "open source" attitude: write good documentation and code comments, share knowledge, collaborate to implement the best solutions.
    I try to keep up to date and experiment with new technologies.

    My current stack is Python, FastAPI/Flask, MongoDB, gRPC, PostgreSQL, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, Celery, Redis, on both macOS and Linux.
    In the past, I have worked with other languages (Kotlin, PHP, C#, C++, ASP.NET), databases (MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, SQLite) and operating systems (Windows).
